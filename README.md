# Isotropic Directional Solidification using Kobayashi Model

`KobatashiIso` solves the coupled equations to model migration of solid/liquid interface. 
The package solves phase-field equation and heat equation with latent heat term. Only isotropic 
interfacial energy is assumed which will simulate isotropic directional growth.

The phase-field equation is solved using implicit-explicit scheme, whereas heat equation is solved 
using backward Euler scheme.
