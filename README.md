# Isotropic Directional Solidification using Kobayashi Model

`KobatashiIso` solves the coupled equations to model migration of solid/liquid interface. 
The package solves phase-field equation and heat equation with latent heat term. Only isotropic 
interfacial energy is assumed which will simulate isotropic directional growth.
